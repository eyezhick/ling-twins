# Semantic Doppelgängers 🌍

*"Language is the dress of thought." - Samuel Johnson*

## The Story Behind This Project

Have you ever marveled at how the same profound truth can be expressed in wildly different ways across languages and cultures? Consider how "The early bird catches the worm" in English becomes "A quien madruga, Dios le ayuda" (God helps those who rise early) in Spanish, or how Shakespeare's "All the world's a stage" finds its echo in modern tweets about life being like a video game.

This project was born from a fascination with these linguistic parallels - the way different cultures, time periods, and contexts express the same semantic core through unique linguistic structures. It's not just about translation or simple paraphrasing; it's about uncovering the hidden semantic DNA that connects seemingly disparate expressions across the linguistic landscape.

## What We're Building

Semantic Doppelgängers is a sophisticated tool that bridges the gap between computational linguistics and cross-cultural language analysis. It employs state-of-the-art multilingual embeddings to discover semantic parallels that traditional NLP approaches might miss.

### Key Features

- 🔍 Cross-lingual semantic search with support for 100+ languages
- 📚 Multi-domain analysis (literature, social media, news, poetry)
- 🌐 Cultural and temporal language variant detection
- 🎯 Stylistic and syntactic variation analysis
- 🧠 Advanced embedding space alignment techniques
- 📊 Linguistic feature extraction and comparison
- 🔄 Bidirectional semantic mapping across languages
- 🎨 Style transfer and cultural adaptation

### Linguistic Capabilities

- **Cross-Cultural Analysis**: Compare how different cultures express similar concepts
- **Temporal Language Evolution**: Track how expressions evolve across time periods
- **Stylistic Variation**: Analyze how the same meaning is expressed in different registers
- **Semantic Drift Detection**: Identify subtle shifts in meaning across contexts
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Understand how concepts are adapted across cultures
- **Pragmatic Analysis**: Consider context and cultural implications in matching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)
- 16GB+ RAM

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-doppelgangers.git
cd semantic-doppelgangers

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

```python
from semantic_doppelgangers import DoppelgangerFinder

# Initialize the finder with linguistic analysis enabled
finder = DoppelgangerFinder(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/LaBSE",
    enable_linguistic_features=True
)

# Find semantic twins with linguistic analysis
results = finder.find_doppelgangers(
    "Life is like a box of chocolates",
    top_k=5,
    domains=["literature", "social_media"],
    analyze_linguistic_features=True
)

# Print results with linguistic analysis
for result in results:
    print(f"Similarity: {result.similarity:.2f}")
    print(f"Text: {result.text}")
    print(f"Language: {result.language}")
    print(f"Source: {result.source}")
    print(f"Linguistic Features:")
    print(f"- Style: {result.style}")
    print(f"- Register: {result.register}")
    print(f"- Cultural Context: {result.cultural_context}")
    print("---")
```
